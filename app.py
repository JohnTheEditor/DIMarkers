No more manually typing out all your opticals for your DI Turnovers!

Create a CSV from the Media Composer Sequence Report tool, drop it here, and convert it into a `.txt` file to import back to Avid.

**Best Practices:**  
- Dupe your sequence, delete all audio tracks  
- Only select *Effects Location List* on your Sequence Report  
- Choose CSV (or this won't work!)

It will skip effects like Submasters & Matte Keys that you typically wouldn't want to be included anyways.

Your files will never be stored/uploaded/used to train advanced AI Assistant Editors.
